            Imagine you are at home one evening and the phone is ringing. You answer the phone and
            the person on the other side of the line introduces himself as an inspector from the
            homicide squad, who has a few questions for you. This will hopefully never happen
            to most of us. But I am pretty sure, that in such a case most of us will shocked
            and speechless.

            Apparently it had happened to English grandmaster Raymond Keene thirty years ago. I
            recently found an <a href="https://www.thearticle.com/the-great-chess-murder-challenge" target="_blank">article</a>, where he shared that story. It is a fantastic read with a lot of
            twists and turns.
        </p>

        <p>
            The English police had arrested a man, who was the main suspect in the disappearance
            (and suspected murder) of his girl friend. In his prison cell he had written cryptic messages
            on the wall, which the inspector described as chess diagrams and chess notation. As
            Raymond Keene was well known because of his chess column in the Times, the inspector
            asked for his support.
        </p>

        <p>
            Raymon Keene agreed and received shortly afterwards the above mentioned diagrams
            and notation. These proved not to be classical chess diagrams and notations (look at the
            image), but nevertheless Keene's was already hooked to the case and started working on
            the problem. In the best Sherlock Holmes approach he was able to work out most the
            mystery, but not all. So there is still some mysteries to be solved in this story.
