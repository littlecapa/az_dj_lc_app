        <h2>In Whitney's shadow</h2>
        <h3>From Yosemite National Park to Death Valley – and right through chess history</h3>

        <p>
            This June, I had the pleasure of enjoying a wonderful holiday in the southwest of the
            United States with my wife. From San Francisco, we visited the major national parks in
            California, Nevada, Utah and Arizona, gaining unforgettable impressions along the way.
            Such a trip involves long drives, as the parks are far apart. It's easy to end up passing many
            interesting places on the way from one park to the next. That almost happened to me as
            we were driving along Highway 395 from Yosemite National Park to Death Valley and
            passed the following town sign.
        </p>

        <!-- Secondary Image (Town Sign) -->
        <img src="{% static 'homepage/img/lone_pine.png' %}" alt="Lone Pine Town Sign" class="blog-image">

        <p>
            When I saw the sign, something clicked. There was something familiar! Weren't there
            chess tournaments held in a place called Lone Pine? But were they held here or in another
            town with the same name?
        </p>

        <p>
            But a quick look at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lone_Pine_International" target="_blank">Wikipedia</a> confirmed that I was indeed in the right place. So I began
            to follow the traces of chess history. The results of my research I published in this
            <a href="https://en.chessbase.com/post/chess-tournaments-lone-pine" target="_blank">chessbase article</a>.
